                <h3>About me</h3>
                As a child, I have fallen in love with games and spent a lot of time enjoying them. Bit by bit, I started to admire those, who
                create such entertaining worlds and decided to become one of them. That is how I started coding and became obsessed
                with the idea of using my programming skills to create games and apps others would love. In 2015 I first started tinkering
                with Unity and, later on, Unreal Engine 4. In 2018 I enrolled at one of the best IT universities - ITMO, founded my own
                gamedev club, and got my first job as a Unity Developer one year later. By that moment I was already proficient in C# and
                C++.
                As a Unity Developer, I managed to further improve my programming and solution solving skills, as well as acquire solid
                communication and management skill. I got proficient in the development of mobile and desktop games, setting up
                client-server communication, and usage of different profiling tools. What is more, I had experience leading a small project.

                        I have participated in the development of several different projects, some of them being iOS\Android games.
                        During that time I have designed and developed frontend communication with a server, programmed
                        gameplay mechanics as well as worked with custom file serialization and app profiling. Also had a chance to
                        act as the lead programmer on a small project.
